# Pet's Home
## An app connects pets buyers and pet breeders

### Potential pet buyers may have tough pet transportation experience and limited choices when they choose ideal pets. Our App will help! Introducing Pet's Home.
According to the research, more than 40% of buyers need to drive at least 1.5 hours to get their dream puppy home. Meanwhile, some buyers are limited to local breeders due to a lack of transportation modes. The ease of Pet's Home's transportation can help them to expand their choices. Similar to potential pet buyers, breeders can expand their potential customers with us. We offer more than a bridge.
